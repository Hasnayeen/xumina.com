## Panel route prefix

To change route prefix path for a panel, call `prefix` method on the panel class inside panel provider `register` method

<Code lang="php" code={`
    public function register(): void
    {
        $this->panel = app('xumina')->registerPanel('App');
        $this->panel->prefix('/');
    }`}
/>

## Authorization

You can control access to an entire panel based on custom logic via the panel `authorize` method.

<Code lang="php" code={`    public function boot(): void
    {
        $this->panel
            ->authorize(fn($user) => $user->isAdmin())
    }
`} />

## Root Page

By default a dashboard page is created when you create a panel and it's the root page of that panel. When you visit a panel you'll land on the dashboard page. You can customize which page should be treated as root by using `rootPage` method

<Code lang="php" code={`
    public function boot(): void
    {
        $this->panel
            ->layout(DefaultLayout::class)
            ->rootPage(\\My\\Custom\\Page::class);
    }
`} />

## Layout

By default the `DefaultLayout` is used for panel layout, but you can use a custom layout via `layout` method. More on [Layout Docs](/guides/layout/#changing-layout)

## Theme

By default the `DefaultTheme` is used, to use a different theme use `theme` method. More on [Theme Docs](/guides/themes/#changing-theme)
