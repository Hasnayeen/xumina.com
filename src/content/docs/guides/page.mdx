A page corresponds to a page in the app where you define the main content. A resource page contains one main get route and may contains other routes (post, put, delete).

## Defining content

The main content of the page is defined in the outline method.

<Code lang="php" code={`
    // CreateCategory.php
    public function outline(): array
    {
        return [
            Form::make('category')
                ->fields([])
        ];
    }
`} />
