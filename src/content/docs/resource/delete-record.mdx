Record deletion does not have a dedicated page but can be deleted from [View Record](/resource/view-record) and [Edit Record](/resource/edit-record) page.

In view page a delete action button exists on page header section to delete the associated record. A confirmation dialog will be open on clicking the button.

## After callback

To run some code after a record has been deleted, you can chain `after` method in controller and pass a closure to execute after record has been deleted.

<Code lang="php" code={`
    public function destroy(Category $category, ViewCategory $page)
    {
        return $page
            ->delete($category)
            ->after(fn () => SendMailToAdmin::dispatch());
    }
`} />
